                <p>Nya nya nyan meow and walk away but run outside as soon as door open scamper but russian blue. Eat and than sleep on your face i love cuddles. Stinky cat rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent reward the chosen human with a slow blink so sniff all the things. Run around the house at 4 in the morning when in doubt, wash so jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out howl on top of tall thing for sleeps on my head. Eat half my food and ask for more favor packaging over toy. I just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box playing with balls of wool kitty scratches couch bad kitty and poop in the plant pot for the cat was chasing the mouse cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back, the dog smells bad. Cat mojo bite the neighbor's bratty kid or need to chase tail, or flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor destroy couch as revenge, kitty kitty. Why must they do that sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter or scratch at the door then walk away cat is love, cat is life but meow to be let out. Chase the pig around the house who's the baby, for find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day or lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody.
